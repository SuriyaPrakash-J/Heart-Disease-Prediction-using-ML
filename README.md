# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-ML
This project is focused on predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using a dataset containing various health parameters. The goal is to develop an accurate predictive model that can assist in early diagnosis and risk assessment.

# Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning models. By analyzing health parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more, we can assess the risk and provide early warnings.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains various medical parameters like:
- Age  
- Sex  
- Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol Levels  
- Heart Rate  
- Other relevant features  

## ⚙️ Features & Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical data.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Understanding data distributions and feature importance.  
3. **Feature Engineering** - Selecting the most influential features.  
4. **Model Training** - Using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.  
5. **Model Evaluation** - Measuring performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
